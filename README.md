## This is a collection of mini-Python games, made to be loads of fun! 
Jump right in and enjoy all the different games waiting for you in the World of Games!

## The Guess Game
The Guess Game starts by randomly picking a secret number between 0 and the "difficulty." Then, you have to guess what that secret number is by typing in your guess!

## The Currency Roulette Game
Currency Roulette Game! It uses special magic to find out how much one U.S. dollar is worth in Israeli Shekels (ILS). Then, it picks a secret number between 1 and 100, and you have to guess how much that is in U.S. dollars converted to Israeli Shekels! How close you get depends on how hard you want the game to be!

## The Memory Game
The Memory Game is all about testing your memory! First, it shows you a bunch of random numbers quicklyâ€”whoosh! Then, it's your turn to try to remember what those numbers were and type them! Can you remember them all? Let's find out!
